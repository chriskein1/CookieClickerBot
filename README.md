# CookieClickerBot
Python script using Selenium to automate the game of Cookie Clicker

Current logic:
  - Click cookies for 5 seconds straight
  - Purchase every available product, starting with the best product, as many times as possible
  - After purchasing products, purchase every crate possible
  - Automatically scroll to the correct level for each crate/product
  - Load game upon game start (just drag .txt file into bot's directory and ensure it is the only .txt file)
  - Save and quit by pressing Q on your keyboard: old save file will be overwritten and new save will be downloaded to the same directory

Chrome driver should be placed in the respective directory.
